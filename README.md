# Music-Organizer
I created this because of some legacy music library/folder structures that had songs from a single album in many differnet folders. This utility organizes music folder structures into a logical grouping of artist name folders containing albumn folders. Enjoy.

Path values are still hard coded....the values were meant to run over a network....I need to make the paths configuration values in the app.config file.
