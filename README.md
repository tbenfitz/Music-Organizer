# Music-Organizer
This is a music library organizer that I created for my girlfriend at the time to organize disparate music libraries, where songs for a single album could be located in multiple, randomly named, folders. The music organizer will create a sensical folder structure, based on artist, then album, and organize the songs accordingly. Enjoy!

Path values are located in app.config....the values were meant to run over a network, but can be any logical path.
